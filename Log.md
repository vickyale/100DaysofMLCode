# 100 Days Of ML Code 

### Day 0: August 25, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: I'll check all the neccesary tools are going to use to start the challenge and search a user case with focus in social resposability to apply.

**Thoughts:** Hope will help me in learning Machine Learning in a more fun and effective way .

### Day 1: August 26, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Starting with a Introduction to Linear Algebra and to Mathematics for ML.

**Thoughts:** Review a basics math topics, for example linear equations.

### Day 2: August 27, 2018 

**Today's Progress**: Samples of elimination with matrices

**Thoughts:** It's Ok to refresh concepts and practice with more dimensions.

### Day 3: August 28, 2018 

**Today's Progress**:  Linear algebra, multiplication and inverse matrices

**Thoughts:** Not difficult, using Jupyter Notebook to reply same exercises.
